# Physics and Chemistry Simulations

This is a Unity project for a series of simulations for various fields in physics and chemistry, such as projectile motion, Snell's law, and electronegativity. This was my first Unity project that I used mostly as a way to understand how to use the engine. The scripts and assets are available here to view; running it would require opening it in Unity. To see another Unity project that has a visible end product, see the following project: https://github.com/PikaToo/LilRatMaze

Original Creation: May 2023
